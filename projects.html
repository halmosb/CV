                <img src="img/projects/exp_vortices.jpg" alt="Phase of the beam">
                <p>The goal of the project was to investigate exparimentally the propagation of optical vortices. It was part of the research training program at <a href="https://research.tuni.fi/eqo/" target="_blank">Experimental Quantum Optics Group</a> at Tampere University in 2024.</p>
                <p>My assignments were first to take mesurements at different distances of propagation, then to analyze the data using MATLAB. For the analysis, I have created a custom MATLAB App which enables us to do the analysis using graphical interface. I was also using parallel workers to make the calculation faster.</p>

                <p>My assignments were to implement the method in python then, after introducing new parameters, to run it on GPUs and evaluate the accuary of the method. For the calulations python and PyTorch package were used and GitHub for version control. About our results we are currently writing scientific articles.<br/>There were a summer school for high school students, where I supervised and showed the students how our method worked.</p>

                <p>The goal of the project was to create a custom app which helps me learn the vocabulary of a new language, namely Finnish. I have included several features in the app which I find useful in my learning. I have created it in python and during the project I learnt how to use many python libraries to for example translate and read text. I created it in 2023 and I use the app regularly.</p>

                <h2>Robot and computer vision</h2>
                <img src="img/projects/wigner-robot.jpg" alt="The robot">
                <p>The goal of the project was to build a robot and its communication protocol with the server, then to analyze the video from its camera with different computer vision techniques. It was part of my internship at <a href="https://wigner.hu/en/department-computational-sciences/data-and-compute-intensive-sciences-research-group" target="_blank">Data and Compute Intensive Sciences Research Group</a> at HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics in 2022 - 2024.</p>
                <p>My assignments were to implement the code which controls the movement and the sensors of the robot, then to analyze the data from them. The code was written in python and the video analysis were done by OpenCV and PyTorch.</p>

                <p>The goal of the project was to create a special game for first and second year elemntary school students at <a href="https://www.mozgasjavito.hu/english/" target="_blank">Movement Development Primary and Secondary School</a> in 2019. The students there have numerous physical disabilities, therefore the game for them has to be custom made: the goal was to create a fun game which can be played with only 2 buttons on the keyboard. I have created a game where there are different animals on the image and the players has to choose which animal (or which animal sound) corresponds to which animal. An improved version of the game is still used.</p>
